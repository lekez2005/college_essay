          <p>AdmiTid is a collaborative college application editing platform. As part of a larger web app which will allow High-school students to organize all of their application materials, the collaborative essay platform is created to pilot the project. The platform allows a user (applicant) to upload essays, invite collaborators, view each collaborators input and suggestions on essay separately and ultimately inculcate all feedback into the master essay in real time.

</p><p>This web app also allows the user to chat individually and as a group with all collaborators.</p>
